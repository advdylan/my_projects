# AutoWood
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

AutoWood is web application that purpose is to control the production process. It's created around SQL database to help different parts of company keep the track of production process. It involves the Warehouse, Orders and Productions subpages.
I would like to describe each of the sections.

#### Database

For the purpose of this project, I wrote code to import database from Excell XLS file. It's save for future usage but inactive for now as database is complete. It's located in helpers.py inside impdb() function:

>def impdb():

#### Orders

Orders is the main part of the application. Although the production process doesnt start here, all actions and status are visible here.
